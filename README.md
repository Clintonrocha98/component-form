This is code from a React application that represents a user registration form. The form has fields for "nome", "email", "senha", "cep", "rua", "n√∫mero", "bairro", "cidade" e "estado".

The application uses the React hook "useState" to manage the state of the form and its submission. The initial state of the form is created through a "reduce" method that returns an empty object with the keys of the form fields.

The "handleSubmit" function is invoked when the form is submitted and makes a "fetch" call to the "https://ranekapi.origamid.dev/json/api/usuario" API with the POST method, sending the contents of the form in the body of the request as JSON. The result of the request is stored in the "response" state.

The function "handleChange" is invoked whenever there is a change in a field of the form and updates the "form" state with the value of the changed field.

The "input" component is imported from "./components/input" and represents each of the form fields. It is passed as props to the "Input" component: "label", "type", "id", "value" and "onChange".

The message "Data sent successfully" is displayed if the response of the request has status "ok".

The "App" component is exported as application default.
